Certainly! Let's go through a dry run of the `passThePillow` method step-by-step with an example.

### Example
Let's assume \( n = 5 \) (there are 5 people in the circle) and \( time = 7 \) seconds.

1. **Initialization**:
    - \( n = 5 \)
    - \( time = 7 \)

2. **Repeat Cycle Calculation**:
    - Repeat cycle is calculated as \( (n - 1) * 2 \). 
    - For \( n = 5 \): \( (5 - 1) * 2 = 8 \) seconds.

3. **Time Modulus Operation**:
    - The time after taking modulus is calculated as \( time \% (n - 1) * 2 \).
    - For \( time = 7 \): \( 7 \% 8 = 7 \).

4. **Determine Direction**:
    - Check if the current time (7) is less than \( n \):
      - \( 7 < 5 \) is `false`.

5. **Backward Calculation**:
    - Since the above condition is `false`, we need to calculate the backward movement:
    - Return \( n - (time - (n - 1)) \).
    - \( 5 - (7 - 4) = 5 - 3 = 2 \).

So, for \( n = 5 \) and \( time = 7 \), the pillow is with person **2**.

### Summary
The dry run shows that the `passThePillow` method works correctly by first calculating the repeat cycle and then determining whether the time falls within the forward or backward direction, finally calculating the position of the pillow based on the elapsed time.
